# Internship_SHAO

In this period of time, I have done these things as below:

* Firstly, I read the paper about the EOB formalism which helped me build a kind of an intuition.----------Less than 1 week.
* Secondly, I tried to code the simplist situation———spherical orbit without considering the effect caused by spins of the BBH.--------2 week
* Thirdly, I tried to code the harder situation ————spherical orbit with the effect caused by spins of the BBH. --------1 week
* Forthly, I tried to code the harder situation————ecliptic orbit without considering the effect caused by spins of the BBH.--------3 days
* Fifthly, I tried to code the harder situation————ecliptic orbit considering the effect caused by spins of the BBH.--------3 days
